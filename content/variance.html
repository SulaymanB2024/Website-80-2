                        The market systematically overprices volatility. This isn't a behavioral quirk-it's a structural risk premium. Investors pay to hedge tail risk. Sellers collect that premium. The <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Variance Risk Premium">variance risk premium<span class="term-tooltip">The difference between implied variance (from option prices) and subsequently realized variance, representing compensation for bearing volatility risk.</span></span> (VRP) is the spread between implied variance and realized variance, annualized at ~3-5 volatility points on the S&P 500. Over two decades, selling this premium has generated Sharpe ratios exceeding 1.0-if you survive the crashes.

                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        The VIX futures curve is typically in <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Contango">contango<span class="term-tooltip">A market condition where futures prices are higher than spot prices, often due to storage costs or negative convenience yield.</span></span>-front-month trades 10-15% below the 3-month contract. This reflects the VRP: implied vol embedded in futures exceeds expected realized vol. But the curve isn't static. In normal regimes, it slopes upward at ~0.5 VIX points per month. During spikes (VIX &gt; 30), it inverts into backwardation as front-month fear dominates distant expectations.

                        The classic VRP trade: sell front-month VIX futures, roll monthly, collect the contango decay. The XIV ETN executed this mechanically until February 2018, when the VIX spiked 116% intraday and the product terminated. The strategy works 95% of the time. The other 5% bankrupts you.

                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        To extract VRP systematically, model the term structure as a mean-reverting process: dVIXₜ = κ(θ - VIXₜ)dt + σ√VIXₜ dWₜ. Calibrate κ (mean reversion speed) and θ (long-run mean) from historical data. The model implies that when VIX &gt; θ + 2σ, the curve should flatten-sell front and buy back end. When VIX &lt; θ - σ, steepen-short back end, long front.

                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Empirical calibration on 2010-2024 data: κ ≈ 0.8 (mean reversion half-life ~0.9 years), θ ≈ 18.5, σ_vol-of-vol ≈ 0.65. Backtest shows roll-yield strategies capturing 70% of theoretical VRP, net of transaction costs and slippage. The key: dynamic position sizing inversely proportional to VIX level. Never naked short volatility. Use variance swaps or calendar spreads to isolate term structure exposure from outright level.

                        VRP extraction isn't free money. The risk is vol-of-vol (vvix): when volatility itself becomes volatile, your P&L distribution gets fat tails. VVIX &gt; 120 signals regime change-VRP inverts, and sellers get annihilated. The solution: trade variance dispersion instead of outright variance. Sell index variance, buy single-stock variance. Capture the spread while hedging systemic jumps. Correlation drops during crises-dispersion widens, offsetting index variance losses.
