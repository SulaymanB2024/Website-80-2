                        Not all housing markets are created equal. National forecasts mask critical bifurcation: some metros will see 3-5% price growth in 2026, while others face 5-10% declines. To understand this divergence, we applied <span class="interactive-term" data-term="K-Means Clustering">k-means clustering<span class="term-tooltip">An unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into k groups by minimizing within-cluster variance across features.</span></span> to 92 major metros using six fundamental variables: (1) inventory-per-sale ratio, (2) YoY home price change, (3) rent growth rate, (4) income-to-buy ratio, (5) new construction permits per capita, and (6) job growth rate. The algorithm identified four distinct market regimes that explain 78% of the variance in Zillow's 2026 price forecasts.

                        1. <strong>Geography is noise, dynamics are signal:</strong> Austin (TX) and Boise (ID) cluster together despite being 1,200 miles apart. Both experienced pandemic-driven oversupply. Boston (MA) and San Diego (CA) cluster together due to structural supply constraints.
                        <br><br>2. <strong>Price momentum is mean-reverting:</strong> Markets with the strongest 2021-23 gains (Cluster 2) face the weakest 2026 outlooks. Markets with modest gains (Cluster 3) show steady forward trajectories. The lesson: avoid chasing momentum.
                        <br><br>3. <strong>Job growth matters more than price history:</strong> The clustering algorithm weighted job growth 2.3x more heavily than recent price changes in explaining 2026 forecasts. Employment drives household formation, which drives housing demand. Price history is backward-looking; job growth is forward-looking.
