                        Duration is a first-order approximation. <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Convexity">Convexity<span class="term-tooltip">The second derivative of bond price with respect to yield, measuring the curvature of the price-yield relationship.</span></span> is where mortals become gods or corpses. In March 2022, as the Fed pivoted hawkish and 10-year yields spiked 80bps in three weeks, agency MBS portfolios experienced what traders euphemistically call "extension risk." What they actually experienced was financial obliteration.

                        The mathematics are elegant but brutal. For a standard fixed-rate bond, convexity is positive: price increases accelerate as yields fall, and price decreases decelerate as yields rise. You win bigger than you lose. But <span class="interactive-term" data-term="MBS Negative Convexity">mortgage-backed securities<span class="term-tooltip">Agency MBS exhibit negative convexity due to embedded prepayment options held by homeowners.</span></span> embed a prepayment option that homeowners own. When rates fall, refinancing accelerates-your bond gets called away at par just as prices should soar. When rates rise, prepayments stop-you're stuck with a 30-year duration instrument in a rising rate regime.

                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Effective duration for a 30-year 3% MBS coupon sat at ~4.2 years in January 2022 when the 10-year was 1.50%. By June, with the 10-year at 3.00%, that same security's duration had extended to ~7.8 years. The convexity adjustment term in the Taylor series expansion: ΔP ≈ -D × Δy + ½C × (Δy)². For MBS, C &lt; 0. The portfolio hemorrhaged value not just from rising rates, but from the accelerating pace of losses as duration stretched like taffy.

                        Dealers attempted to <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Gamma Hedging">gamma hedge<span class="term-tooltip">Dynamically adjusting delta hedge positions to remain neutral to second-order price movements.</span></span> by selling duration into the selloff-exacerbating the rate spike in a doom loop. The TBA market saw bid-ask spreads blow out to 8/32nds on peak volatility days. Convexity hedging flows became the dominant price action driver, overwhelming fundamental supply-demand dynamics.

                        The failure wasn't in the models-OAS frameworks accurately priced the prepayment risk. The failure was in <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Basis Risk">basis risk<span class="term-tooltip">The risk that hedging instruments don't move perfectly in correlation with the underlying exposure.</span></span> management and liquidity assumptions. Funds hedged with Treasury futures, assuming a stable 90% hedge ratio. When MBS-Treasury spreads widened 45bps in two weeks, the hedge ratio collapsed to 0.65. The "basis" was supposed to be stable. It wasn't.

                        The lesson: Duration measures local sensitivity. Convexity measures how that sensitivity itself changes. In leveraged portfolios with negative convexity, small rate moves trigger large hedge adjustments, which in illiquid markets become self-fulfilling prophecies. The second derivative killed more P&L than the first.
