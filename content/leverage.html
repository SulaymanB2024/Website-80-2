                        Private equity returns are manufactured through three levers: operational improvement, multiple arbitrage, and leverage. The first is hard. The second is cyclical. The third is mechanical-and the most misunderstood. <span class="interactive-term" data-term="LBO">Leveraged buyout<span class="term-tooltip">Acquisition of a company using significant amounts of borrowed money, with the target's cash flows servicing the debt.</span></span> modeling reduces to a question: How much debt can this cash flow sustain? Get it wrong on the high side, and you're in bankruptcy. Get it wrong on the low side, and you leave 500bps of IRR on the table.

                        The traditional metric is <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Debt-to-EBITDA">Debt / EBITDA<span class="term-tooltip">Leverage ratio measuring total debt relative to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.</span></span>. Sponsors target 5.0-6.5x for middle-market buyouts. But EBITDA is a fiction-it's not cash. EBITDA - Capex - Working Capital = Unlevered Free Cash Flow. That's what services debt. In capital-intensive businesses, EBITDA overstates cash generation by 30-40%. In SaaS or asset-light models, the spread is narrower. The correct question: Debt / (EBITDA - Capex - ΔWC). This ratio should not exceed 4.5x for stable cash flows, 3.5x for cyclical.

                        The debt stack is a maturity and seniority ladder: Revolver (L + 250bps), Term Loan B (L + 450bps), Second Lien (L + 750bps), Mezzanine (12-14% PIK toggle). Each tranche has different covenants, amortization schedules, and call protection. The optimization problem: minimize WACC subject to maintaining liquidity and covenant cushion. The revolver stays undrawn (it's insurance, not funding). Term Loan B is the workhorse-7-year maturity, 1% annual amortization, EBITDA-based covenants with 25% cushion.

A Term Loan at L + 450bps with 2% OID and 50bps annual fee has an all-in cost of ~9.3% at current SOFR. Mezzanine at 12% PIK accretes-no cash interest for 3 years, then compounds. The effective cost is 12%, but the cash burden is deferred. This is how sponsors juice Year 1-3 IRR while creating a maturity wall problem in Year 6-7.

                        Savvy sponsors build in EBITDA addbacks: pro forma cost synergies, run-rate revenue from bolt-ons, non-recurring expenses. These are permitted adjustments under credit agreements. A $50M EBITDA business can report $65M "Adjusted EBITDA" by adding back $10M in "one-time" restructuring costs and $5M in "normalized" revenue. Lenders accept this because the alternative is losing the deal to a more aggressive lender. The game is: maximize addbacks without triggering fraud.

                    <h3 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The IRR Mirage and Hidden Costs</h3>
                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        The headline IRR is a lie. LBO models show 25% IRR on 6.0x leverage. Strip out the leverage, and the equity return is 12%. The delta is financial engineering, not value creation. The formula: Levered Return = Unlevered Return + (Unlevered Return - Cost of Debt) × (Debt / Equity). When r_unlevered = 12% and r_debt = 8%, each 1x of leverage adds ~160bps to IRR. At 6x leverage and 40% equity check, you're adding 960bps. That's the ratchet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But leverage is symmetric. A 10% EBITDA miss in Year 2 triggers covenant breach, forces equity cure ($20M cash injection at 0% IRR), and resets the return profile. The hidden costs: management time spent on lender reporting, restricted ability to pursue growth Capex, and forced asset sales to delever during downturns. The model assumes smooth cash flows. Reality is lumpy. The difference between projected and actual is where sponsors earn their carry-or lose their shirts.
