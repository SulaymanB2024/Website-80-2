                        In most discounted cash flow models, 70-85% of enterprise value lives in the <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Terminal Value">terminal value<span class="term-tooltip">The present value of all future cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period, typically calculated using a perpetuity growth method or exit multiple.</span></span> calculation. This is not a feature. This is an admission that we're guessing. And yet, analysts treat the perpetuity growth rate with the reverence of a physical constant. g = 2.5%. Always. Forever. Because GDP.

                        The Gordon Growth Model assumes perpetual constant growth: TV = FCFₙ₊₁ / (WACC - g). Elegant. Convenient. Catastrophically sensitive. A 50bps swing in g or WACC moves valuation by 30-40%. This isn't precision-it's astrology with Greek letters. The model forces infinite compounding at a rate that, if sustained, would make any firm larger than global GDP within a century. We know this is absurd. We plug in the number anyway.

                    <h3 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Exit Multiple Alternative</h3>
                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Exit multiples ground terminal value in empirical reality: TV = EBITDAₙ × EV/EBITDA. The multiple reflects <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Comparable Transactions">comp set analysis<span class="term-tooltip">Valuation methodology using multiples from comparable company transactions or trading values.</span></span>-what buyers actually paid for similar assets. But here's the trap: you're anchoring to current multiples, which embed current growth expectations, which may be wildly optimistic or pessimistic. You've just made the model circular.

                        The intellectually honest approach: decompose the multiple into its fundamental drivers. The implied exit multiple is: (1 - g/ROIC) × (1 + g) / (WACC - g), where ROIC is the perpetual return on incremental invested capital. If ROIC &gt; WACC, the firm creates value through reinvestment. If ROIC &lt; WACC, growth destroys value-the firm should distribute cash, not reinvest it.

                    <p class="font-serif text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        No competitive advantage lasts forever. Instead of assuming constant growth, model a <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Fade Rate">fade rate<span class="term-tooltip">The rate at which a company's excess returns decay toward its cost of capital over time, reflecting competitive pressure.</span></span>: high initial growth decaying toward the risk-free rate over 20-40 years. This reflects economic reality-mean reversion, technological obsolescence, competitive entry. The formula: gₜ = (gᵢₙᵢₜᵢₐₗ - r_f) × e^(-λt) + r_f, where λ is the decay constant calibrated to industry half-life.

                        The fade rate transforms terminal value from a binary guess into a probabilistic decay function. It forces explicit assumptions about durability of competitive moats. And it produces valuations that aren't 80% dependent on what happens after year 10. The math is harder. The intellectual honesty is worth it.
