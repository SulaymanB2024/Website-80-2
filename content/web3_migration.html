                        The client was a mid-sized neobank processing $500M in monthly volume. They wanted "crypto exposure." They didn't understand that they were asking to replace their database with a global, adversarial state machine. Integrating <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Web3 Settlement">on-chain settlement<span class="term-tooltip">Finalizing financial transactions on a blockchain, providing transparency and immutability but requiring strict key management.</span></span> into a Web2 stack is not an API integration; it's a paradigm shift.

                        The immediate hurdle was <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Custody">custody<span class="term-tooltip">The safeguarding of private keys that control digital assets. Self-custody means you hold the keys; third-party custody means a provider holds them.</span></span>. The client wanted to hold user funds. We explained that "holding funds" meant managing private keys in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) with multi-party computation (MPC) signing. One leaked key, and the bank is insolvent. We architected a hybrid solution: a qualified custodian for the bulk of assets, and a hot wallet for daily liquidity, rebalanced automatically via smart contracts.

                        Blockchains don't close at 5 PM. They don't have weekends. The client's legacy ledger expected a daily "end of day" batch process. We built a real-time <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Indexer">indexer<span class="term-tooltip">Software that reads blockchain data, parses it, and stores it in a queryable database (like SQL) for applications to use.</span></span> that listened to chain events and updated the internal SQL ledger. The challenge was handling "reorgs" – when the blockchain rewrites the last few blocks. Our system had to be able to "rewind" the SQL state to match the chain truth.

                        We also implemented a "gas station" network to abstract transaction fees from users. The bank paid the ETH; the user just saw a "Processing..." spinner. It was a seamless UX wrapper around a chaotic decentralized core.

                        The biggest friction was cultural. Compliance officers wanted to "reverse" suspicious transactions. We had to explain immutability. Developers wanted to "hotfix" bugs. We had to explain smart contract audits and timelocks. Bridging Web2 and Web3 isn't just code; it's education. It's teaching a centralized organization how to survive in a decentralized world.
