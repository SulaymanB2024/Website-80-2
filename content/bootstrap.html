                        Every derivative pricing model requires a discount curve. Build it wrong, and every valuation downstream is contaminated. The <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Bootstrapping">bootstrapping algorithm<span class="term-tooltip">An iterative method to extract zero-coupon rates from observed market prices of coupon-bearing bonds or swaps.</span></span> converts messy market quotes-SOFR swaps, Treasury bonds, Eurodollar futures-into a smooth zero-coupon yield curve. The process is both mechanical and surgical. One wrong assumption about day-count conventions or compounding frequency, and your 10-year swap rate is mispriced by 3 basis points. In a $500M notional swap, that's $1.5M of P&L error.

Start with overnight SOFR (currently ~4.35%). For terms beyond O/N, use SOFR futures to build the 3M-2Y segment. Each futures price implies a forward rate: F = 100 - Price. Convert to continuous compounding: r_continuous = ln(1 + r_simple × Δt) / Δt, where Δt is the accrual fraction (ACT/360 for USD swaps).

                        For maturities beyond 2 years, SOFR swaps provide the data. A 5-year swap at 4.25% fixed means the present value of fixed flows equals the present value of floating flows: Σ [C × DF(tᵢ)] = Σ [Fwd(tᵢ₋₁, tᵢ) × DF(tᵢ)], where C is the fixed coupon, DF(t) is the discount factor at time t, and Fwd is the forward SOFR rate.

                        Bootstrap iteratively: solve for DF(t₁) using the 1Y swap, then DF(t₂) using the 2Y swap and the already-known DF(t₁), and so on. At each tenor, invert the discount factor to get the zero rate: z(t) = -ln[DF(t)] / t. The result is a discrete set of zero rates at swap maturity points: 1Y, 2Y, 3Y, ..., 30Y.

                        Market quotes are sparse. You have zeros at 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y. But you need a rate for 4.25Y to price a bespoke swaption. Interpolation fills the gaps. Linear interpolation of zero rates is crude and creates artificial discontinuities in forward rates. <span class="interactive-term" data-term="Cubic Spline">Cubic splines<span class="term-tooltip">A piecewise polynomial interpolation method ensuring smooth first and second derivatives across the curve.</span></span> are smoother but can generate economically implausible forward rate oscillations.

For ultra-long tenors (&gt;30Y), extrapolate using the Smith-Wilson method, which asymptotically converges to an ultimate forward rate (typically UFR = 3.8% for USD, per EIOPA guidelines adapted to US regulatory context).

                        Covered interest parity says: F/S = (1 + r_d) / (1 + r_f), where F is the forward FX rate, S is spot, r_d is domestic rate, r_f is foreign rate. In theory, no arbitrage.

                        When building a USD curve from EUR swaps (or vice versa), adjust for the basis: r_USD_implied = r_EUR + basis + FX_forward_adjustment. The 5Y EUR/USD basis widened to -60 bps during COVID. Ignoring it would misprice cross-currency swaps by millions. The basis isn't noise-it's structural, driven by dollar shortage in offshore funding markets and balance sheet costs for dealers.
